# VimScry

A Magic the Gathering plugin for vim.

VimScry combines the power of Vim, with the utility of Scryfall, making a simple
deckbuilding experience. Decks are collections of cards, represented by names
in even the most advanced deck trackers. So now you can have built in Scryfall
integration from within your text editor.
